Web-Based Site Scraper

Project Overview

This project is to create a web-based application that scrapes data from various websites, such as Google and Facebook and more. The scraped data is presented in a structured table format using Bootstrap for a responsive and user-friendly interface. Additionally, the data is stored in a PostgreSQL database for further manipulation and retrieval.

Features

1.Web Scraping: The application scrapes data from websites like Google, Facebook, etc., using the BeautifulSoup4 Python library.
2.Data Display: Scraped data is displayed in a dynamic table with Bootstrap, providing an organized and mobile-responsive layout.
3.Database Storage: After scraping, the data is stored in a PostgreSQL database for persistence.
4.Data Management: Users can delete unwanted data entries from the database through a "Delete" button integrated into the table.
5.CRUD Operations: The application allows for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) operations on the scraped data through Django models.

Technology Stack

1.Python: Used for backend logic and web scraping with BeautifulSoup4.
2.Django: Provides the framework for building the web application and handling data management.
3.Bootstrap: Ensures responsive design and clean UI for displaying scraped data.
4.BeautifulSoup4: A Python library for web scraping.
5.PostgreSQL: A robust relational database used for storing and managing scraped data.

How It Works

-The user initiates the scraping process.
-Data is extracted from the target websites using BeautifulSoup4.
-The scraped data is displayed in a Bootstrap-powered table on the web interface.
-Data is stored in a PostgreSQL database for future retrieval and management.
-The user can delete any specific data from the table, which also removes it from the database.
